                  <h3>Programming</h3>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned before, I have been programming since I was in
                    6th grade. As such I have a large amount of enjoyment for
                    the activity. I very much enjoy the problem solving aspect
                    of the task, as well as the abilty to write code to reach an
                    objective no matter the size.

                  <h3>Web Design</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have had many opportunities to develop websites, having
                    taken 2 web design courses, and this site being the final
                    project for my third. I have also as previously mentioned
                    worked as a web developer for Oasis Digital. As such I get
                    very aggravated any time I see bad Web Design.

                  <h3>Gaming History</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have spent weeks worth of time learning about the history
                    of the video game industry. From Tennis For Two to modern
                    titles, I have a great enjoyment for everything tangentualy
                    related to games and their development.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3>Game Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Game development was my original passion. It is the reason I
                    got into programming in the first place. Unfortunately the
                    current state of the industry means that joining an an
                    established company would be a bad Idea. With the prevalence
                    of Crunch and Employee mistreatment. Game development is my
                    passion, Application development is my compromise
