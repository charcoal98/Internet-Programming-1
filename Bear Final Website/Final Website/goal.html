                Finishing school is the goal that come before all my other
                goals. Finishing school would give me more opportunities in the
                work force. Technically I don’t need a degree, because of my
                connections I could join the work force.

                I want to learn the C programming language as it is very low
                level, Compared to what I have been using. Learning C would help
                me understand other languages better such as C+ and C++. It
                would also look good on my resume.

                Get a job in development or IT. I want to get a job that I can
                enjoy but won't drain me of energy for my other hobbies. I have
                enjoyed IT in the past as well as Programming.
